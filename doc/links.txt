Bluemix and video streaming
---------------------------

The idea of this article is trying to deploy an app in Bluemix
to stream videos, looking at the Bluemix services page I found
the ustream services where you can get a free account to publish
up to 10GB of videos.

I downloaded and installed the cf client, then created a Bluemix account
and login against the bluemix cf api. Like the  documentation says I created
the ustream service and then  I started writting a tiny cuba app with form
to upload a video and then try to login against ustream api using the ruby oauth2
library but I coudnt make it work it always raise this error:

{"error":"invalid_request"}

without any other information or detail, and the time box assigned for this end.
